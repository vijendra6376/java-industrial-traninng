Introduction
This is a simple console-based "Guess the Number" game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number between a specified range, and the player has to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts.

How to Play
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your favorite Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or use the command line).

Open the GuessTheNumber.java file.
Compile and run the program.
Game Rules
The game will generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
You will be given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
After each guess, the game will provide feedback, telling you if your guess is too high or too low.
Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
Configuration
You can configure the game by modifying the following variables in the GuessTheNumber.java file:

MIN_RANGE: The minimum value for the random number.
MAX_RANGE: The maximum value for the random number.
MAX_ATTEMPTS: The maximum number of attemptsÂ allowed.
